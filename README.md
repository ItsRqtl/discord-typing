# typing
A open source python bot that types forever.

## Installation
You can install all required modules/library by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br />
You also need to create a file `.env` under the same directory with your token in it. (`token=INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN`)

## Usage
There is only 3 commands.<br />
`/typing <nickname(optional)>` to start typing in a channel with specific nickname (if provided).<br />
`/stop` to stop the bot from typing.<br />
`/invite` to invite the bot. (You can change the invite link in line 16.)
